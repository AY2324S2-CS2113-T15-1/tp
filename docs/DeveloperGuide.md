## Design & implementation
### Adding calorie entries feature

#### Implementation

This functionality is facilitated by `UI`, `CalorieList`, `FileHandler` and `ParserCalories`. It implements one operation, namely:
- `UI#handleCaloriesInput(String, CalorieList)`
- `CalorieList#addEntry(String)`
- `ParserCalories#parseCaloriesInput(String)`
- `FileHandler#updateFile()`

This feature is activated when the user inputs a `calories in` or `calories out` command in the terminal.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves at every step:

- Step 1: When the user inputs the command `calories in burger c/200 d/2024-02-02` in the terminal,
the string is sent to `UI#handleCaloriesInput(String, CalorieList)`, which calls `CalorieList#addEntry(String)`.

- Step 2: Inside `CalorieList#addEntry(String)`, the function `ParserCalories#parseCaloriesInput(String)` is then called to extract information such as the description, number of calories, and date of entry.

- Step 3: The obtained information is sent to the private method `ParserCalories#makeNewInputEntry(String, int, String)` to create a new entry of class `InputEntry` that extends `Entry`. An `Entry` object is then returned to the caller, `CalorieList#addEntry(String)`.

- Step 4: The returned `Entry` object is added into the `calorieArrayList` member of type `ArrayList<Entry>` in the `CalorieList`, via the `ArrayList.add()` method.

- Step 5: `FileHandler#updateFile()` is then called to update the data file with the new entry in the `CalorieList`.

The sequence diagram for this feature is shown below:

### Calculating calorie requirements based on a user`s goals

#### Implementation

This functionality is facilitated by `UserGoals`. It implements one operation, namely:
- `UserGoals#getHealthInfo(User)`

This operation is exposed in the `User` class as `User#getHealhInfo()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves at every step:
- Step 1: When the user inputs the command `user progress` in the terminal,
  the string is sent to `User#getHealthInfo()`, which calls `UserGoals#getHealthInfo(User)`.

- Step 2: The method retrieves the user`s information such as his height, weight, age, gender, exercise levels and intended goal.

- Step 3: Using these information, the method creates a `requestBody` `String`. 

- Step 4: The created `requestBody` is used to send a `HttpRequest` to RapidAPI`s Fitness API, and the response is parsed to determine the number of calories a user needs to consume according to their personal goals.

- Step 5: This value is set to `User.caloriesRequired` by `User#setCaloriesRequired(int)`.

#### Design considerations

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses an API to get the calories needed
    - Pros: No need to figure out the optimal algorithm
    - Cons: Need to parse response to sieve out necessary information

- **Alternative 2:** Uses an algorithm to find the number of calories needed
  - Pros: Not dependent on external APIs
  - Cons: Need to come up with an algorithm to use

### Calories list feature

The `calories list` feature lists out the record of all the Calories data that the user has keyed in. The Calories data are all stored into a `ArrayList<Entry> calorieArrayList` attribute of the `CalorieList` Class. Calories data are printed when the `printCalorieList()` function is called. 

The `printCalorieList()` function iterates through the `calorieArrayList` and prints out the Entries according to its order in the Array List.

The Class diagram and sequence diagram for Calories list feature is shown below. Unrelated attributes and Classes were excluded.

### Calories delete feature

The `calories delete` feature can delete the calories record at specific index of calorie list. This functionality is facilitated by `CaloriesList`. It implements one operation, namely:
- `deleteEntry(String line)`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves at every step:
- Step 1: When the user inputs the command `calories delete INDEX` in the terminal, the string is sent to `Ui#handleUserInput()`, which will call `Ui#handleCaloriesInput()`.

- Step 2: After the `Ui#handleCaloriesInput()` matching `delete calories` key word, the string will be passed into deleteEntry(String line) to execute delete process.

- Step 3: The string will be divided to two substrings according to the command syntax. Index will be tried to get from the second substring by `Integer.parseInt()`.

- Step 4: The calories record (`Entry`) stored in the `ArrayList<Entry> caloriesList` will be deleted by calling `calorieArrayList.remove((index-1));` and a successful deleting message will be shown in terminal by calling `CalorieListUi#successfulDeletedMessage(toDelete)`

- Step 5: The latest calories list will be updated to saving file by calling `CalorieList#updateFile()`.

### Parsing user input for hydration entries

This functionality is facilitated by `ParserHydration`. It implements one operation, namely:
- `ParserHydration#parseHydrationInput(String input)`

This operation is exposed in the `HydrationList` class as `HydrationList#addEntry(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves at every step:
- Step 1: When the user inputs the command `hydration in Milo v/100 d/2022-01-02` in the terminal,
  the string is sent to `HydrationList#addEntry(String)`, which calls `ParserHydration#parseHydrationInput(String)`.

- Step 2: Using `String.split()`, the method extracts information such as the description, volume of beverage, and date of entry. The obtained information is sent to the private method `ParserHydration#makeNewInputEntry(String, int, String)` to create a new entry of class `HydrationEntry` that extends `Entry`.

- Step 3: The created `HydrationEntry` instance is added into the `ArrayList<Entry>` attribute of the `HydrationList`.

### Calculating hydration requirements for each user

#### Design Considerations

**General Health Guidelines:** The recommended daily intake of water for an average adult is around 8 glasses or approximately 2000 milliliters. This guideline is commonly recommended by health authorities and organizations such as HealthHub.

**Ease of Implementation:** Setting a standard hydration requirement simplifies the tracking process for users. It provides a clear goal to strive for, making it easier for individuals to monitor and maintain their hydration levels consistently.

### Hydration list feature

The `hydration list` feature lists out the record of all the Hydration data that the user has keyed in. The Hydration data are all stored into a `ArrayList<Entry> hydrationArrayList` attribute of the `HydrationList` Class. Hydration data are printed when the `printHydrationList()` function is called.

The `printHydrationList()` function iterates through the `hydrationArrayList` and prints out the Entries according to its order in the Array List.

The Class diagram for Hydration list feature is shown below. Unrelated attributes and Classes were excluded.

### Parsing user input for sleep entries

This functionality is facilitated by `ParserSleep`. It implements one operation, namely:
- `ParserSleep#parseSleepInput(String input)`

This operation is exposed in the `SleepList` class as `SleepList#addSleep(String)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this mechanism behaves at every step:
- Step 1: When the user inputs the command `sleep add 7.5 d/2022-01-02` in the terminal,
  the string is sent to `SleepList#addEntry(String)`, which calls `ParserSleep#parseSleepInput(String)`.

- Step 2: Using `String.split()`, the method extracts information such as the duration and date of entry.

- Step 3: It will create a new entry of class `SleepEntry` that extends `Entry`based on the information.

- Step 4: The created `SleepEntry` instance is added into the `ArrayList<Entry> sleepList` attribute of the `SleepList`.

The sequence diagram for ParserSleep feature is shown below. Unrelated attributes and Classes were excluded.


### Sleep list feature

The `sleep list` feature lists out the record of all the sleep data that the user has keyed in. The sleep data are all stored into a `ArrayList<Entry> sleepList` attribute of the `SleepList` Class. Sleep data are printed when the `printSleepList()` function is called.

The `printSleepList()` function iterates through the `sleepList` and each entry will call `SleepEntry#toString()` to return its information string to be printed.

The Sequence diagram for Sleep list feature is shown below. Unrelated attributes and Classes were excluded.

### Sleep delete feature

The `sleep delete` feature can delete the sleep record at specific index of sleep list. This functionality is facilitated by `SleepList`. It implements one operation, namely:

### Calculating sleep requirements for each user (Planning)

#### Design Considerations

**General Health Guidelines:** The recommended daily sleep duration for an average adult is around 7.5 hours. However, sleep standard is different for different individual with different healthy status. This feature will calculate recommend sleep duration by formula based on user health information.

**Ease of Implementation:** Setting a standard sleep requirement simplifies the tracking process for users. It provides a clear goal to strive for, making it easier for individuals to monitor and maintain their sleep time levels consistently.
