# LongAh! User Guide

## Introduction

LongAh! is a CLI-based application designed to help users track debts within friend groups and determine the 
least transaction method of settling these debts. It is optimized for busy people with large transaction quantities 
among friends.

## Quick Start

3. Copy the JAR file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your LongAh! application.
4. Open a command terminal, navigate to the folder containing the JAR file and run the command:
```
java -jar CS2113-T15-1.LongAh.jar
```
5. Upon starting the application, you will be prompted to enter your PIN. The user PIN is required to access the application.
The app will prompt you to create your own PIN if it is your first time using the application.

Tracking group balances and expenses has never been easier with LongAh! Users can log transactions between members, facilitating transparent and equitable expense distribution. LongAh! also offers intuitive visualizations, allowing users to quickly assess group financial dynamics at a glance.

### Easily Finding Transactions

Apart from neatly organising users' pending transactions, LongAh! offers a variety of ways for users to conveniently locate the transactions they are interested in by simply providing the related details.

By presenting users with a simplified list of debts and transactions, LongAh! minimizes the effort required to settle financial obligations within the group, fostering smoother financial interactions.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Security

Protecting sensitive financial data is paramount, which is why LongAh! prioritizes security. With the option to set a personalized PIN, users can safeguard their LongAh! accounts against unauthorized access. This additional layer of security ensures peace of mind, knowing that financial information remains confidential and secure. Additionally, users have the flexibility to enable, disable, or modify their PIN settings according to their preferences and needs.

### Data Storage
LongAh! data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
The file is also created automatically if it does not exist.

If all is well, LongAh will save the files in the following data structure during execution.
```
<Your created directory>
│
├─data
│  │  groupList.txt
│  │  pin.txt
│  ├─<group 1 name>
│  │      members.txt
│  │      transactions.txt
│  ├─<group 2 name>
│  │      members.txt
│  │      transactions.txt
│   .
│   .
├─log
│      LongAh.log
└─tp.jar
```

Note: It is not recommended to edit any data files manually. Corrupt lines of data will be ignored and overwritten over the course of the use of the application.

### Data Editing

LongAh! data is saved as a TXT file in the hard disk. Advanced users are welcome to edit the data file directly, but please ensure that the data is in the correct format.
The PIN TXT file contains the pin hash of each user's PIN for security purposes. It is not recommended to edit this file directly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Install LongAh! on the other computer and replace the empty members, pin, and transaction TXT files it creates with the files containing your data.

## Common Errors

### Failure to adhere to command format
Error messages will be output by LongAh! in the event if the user input does not match the corresponding formatting for 
the desired operation. For e.g.
```
lsit transactions
  Invalid command. Use 'help' to see the list of commands.
```
This could be potentially caused by
* Misspelled Action keywords (e.g. lsit transactions instead of list transactions)
* Absence of required user parameters
* Absence of important formatting prefixes (e.g. t/)
* User parameters does not follow intended standards (e.g. Wrong formatting of date & time input)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Invalid Requests
As LongAh! is designed to specifically target transactions taking place in real-life, illogical requests going against 
real-life/system standards may also trigger error messages. For e.g.,
```
add transaction alice t/20-07-2077 2359 p/bob a/200
  Invalid DateTime input. Dates of the future are not allowed.
```
Or
```
add transaction alice p/bob a/200.0005
  Invalid transaction value.
```
This could be potentially caused by
* Invalid parameters (e.g. Dates of the future, Transaction Values more than 2 decimal places)
* Illogical parameters (e.g. A member being both a lender and a borrower within a transaction)

## Known Issues

## Future Improvements

The following quality of life improvements have been taken into consideration and will be implemented in future versions of LongAh!

1. Edit Group Names
2. Settle with Reference to Specific Lender Only
